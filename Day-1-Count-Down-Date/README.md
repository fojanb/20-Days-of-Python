# Count-Down-Date

Count-Down-Date is a CLI application that receives two user's inputs as start and end (dates) following format 
        yyyy-mm-dd:yyyy-mm-dd
Left and right hand side date are representing the start and end date respectively, then calculates how many days are left till end date. It uses the date package and datetime module inside this package which is useful to know about and easy to use.

### Getting Started 

Clone the repo to your computer. Go to your terminal and navigate to the repo folder. Then type "pip install" then enter. This command installs all the packages/modules you need to run the program. A quick note that date module is an in-built package which means does not need installation.

## Prerequisites & Installing

Since Count-Down-Date is a server side python application you need to run that from your terminal. Depend on which OS you are using that can be different. Here is a guide about how to run a node.js app on your computer if you are using windows: http://blog.gvm-it.eu/post/20404719601/getting-started-with-nodejs-on-windows. If you are using mac that would be easier. Just go to your terminal and navigate to the folder. Then you need to download and install all the python modules that are used in this application. So type "pip install" then hit enter. That would install the needed modules.


 
### Running and test

At the start you see a command that asks 'Please enter your start and end date (e.g. yyyy-mm-dd) separated by colon. Here is an example> 2024-05-16:2024-05-20'
Once you inserted your desierd start and dates following the required format please hit enter and you will see a result such this :
INFO:root:Remaining days for your goal <2024-05-13> is 5

## Deployment

This application is not deployed on the web. To run this locally you need to go to your terminal and run the program from there. For more information about how to do that, read the app description, Prerequisites & Installing and Running and test section on this file.
