BMI is an estimate of body fat and a good gauge of your risk for diseases that can occur with more body fat.
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. There are two different formulas to calcualte BMI, Metric System and Imperial System.
|Metric System|BMI = Weight(in kilograms)/Height^2(in meters)|
|Imperial System|BMI = 703*Weight(in pounds)/Height^2(in inches)|
